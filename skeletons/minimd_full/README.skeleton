CONFIGURING
===========
The sst++ compiler wrapper needs to be in the system path. The path to the Eiger
API and lwperf may need to be modified.

BUILDING
========
The provided Makefile is multipurpose: it's used to make several different
versions of the HPCCG app. There are several convenience rules to make the
different versions:

    make
        Builds the native version of the app.
    make instrument
        Builds the native version with lwperf instrumentation added, dumping to
        a file to be replayed into the Eiger database.
    make sstmac
        Builds a version to run in SST/macro but retaining all original
        computation.
    make loop
        Builds a version to run in SST/macro that uses loop compute models
        instead of actual computation.
    make eiger
        Builds a version to run in SST/macro that uses Eiger models created from
        data collected using the lwperf instrumented version.
