The tarball and repo do not come with a standard configure script due to machine-dependent
variations in autotools that have caused problems (mostly with C++11).
To generate a configure script run:

./bootstrap.sh

This will set up the configure environment.
More details can be found in the PDF manual in the top-level directory.
